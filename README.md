🧠 Fashion MNIST - Image Classification using CNN
This project demonstrates the development and training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying clothing images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. It serves as an entry-level deep learning project for recognizing 10 different types of fashion items.

📌 Problem Statement
Manual classification of fashion products is labor-intensive and error-prone, especially in large-scale e-commerce platforms. An automated and accurate classification system is needed to streamline operations and improve user experience.

✅ Proposed Solution
A CNN-based deep learning model is built to automatically classify grayscale images (28x28 pixels) into one of 10 fashion categories, such as T-shirts, trousers, and sneakers.

🧰 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

Dataset: Fashion MNIST (available via keras.datasets)

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🔁 System Workflow
Load and preprocess the dataset

Define CNN architecture

Compile and train the model

Evaluate accuracy on the test set

Visualize performance metrics and predictions

🧮 Algorithm
Model Architecture:

Input: 28x28 grayscale image

2 Convolutional layers + MaxPooling

Flatten + Dense layer with ReLU

Output layer with Softmax (10 classes)

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

Optimizer: Adam

Evaluation Metric: Accuracy

📊 Results
Achieved high accuracy on the test dataset
